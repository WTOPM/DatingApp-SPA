This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * \\@publicApi\n * @param {?} name An identifying string.\n * @param {?} definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of `state()`\n * and `transition()` declarations.\n *\n * @return {?} An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n *\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name, definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n *\n * \\@usageNotes\n * Call within an animation `sequence()`, `{\\@link animations/group group()}`, or\n * `transition()` call to specify an animation step\n * that applies given style data to the parent animation for a given amount of time.\n *\n * ### Syntax Examples\n * **Timing examples**\n *\n * The following examples show various `timings` specifications.\n * - `animate(500)` : Duration is 500 milliseconds.\n * - `animate(\"1s\")` : Duration is 1000 milliseconds.\n * - `animate(\"100ms 0.5s\")` : Duration is 100 milliseconds, delay is 500 milliseconds.\n * - `animate(\"5s ease-in\")` : Duration is 5000 milliseconds, easing in.\n * - `animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\")` : Duration is 5000 milliseconds, delay is 10\n * milliseconds, easing according to a bezier curve.\n *\n * **Style examples**\n *\n * The following example calls `style()` to set a single CSS style.\n * ```typescript\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ```\n * The following example calls `keyframes()` to set a CSS style\n * to different values for successive keyframes.\n * ```typescript\n * animate(500, keyframes(\n *  [\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n *  ])\n * ```\n *\n * \\@publicApi\n * @param {?} timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n * The default unit is milliseconds.\n *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n * during its runtime. Value is one of  `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`,\n * `ease-in-out`, or a `cubic-bezier()` function call.\n * If not supplied, no easing is applied.\n *\n * For example, the string \"1s 100ms ease-out\" specifies a duration of\n * 1000 milliseconds, and delay of 100 ms, and the \"ease-out\" easing style,\n * which decelerates near the end of the duration.\n * @param {?=} styles Sets AnimationStyles for the parent animation.\n * A function call to either `style()` or `keyframes()`\n * that returns a collection of CSS style entries to be applied to the parent animation.\n * When null, uses the styles from the destination state.\n * This is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation;\n * see \"Animating to the final state\" in `transitions()`.\n * @return {?} An object that encapsulates the animation step.\n *\n */\nfunction animate(timings, styles = null) {\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles, timings };\n}\n/**\n * \\@description Defines a list of animation steps to be run in parallel.\n *\n * \\@usageNotes\n * Grouped animations are useful when a series of styles must be\n * animated at different starting times and closed off at different ending times.\n *\n * When called within a `sequence()` or a\n * `transition()` call, does not continue to the next\n * instruction until all of the inner animation steps have completed.\n *\n * \\@publicApi\n * @param {?} steps An array of animation step objects.\n * -

The condition is a Boolean expression or function that compares\n * the previous and current animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur.\n * When the state criteria of a defined transition are met, the associated animation is\n * triggered.\n *\n * \\@usageNotes\n * The template associated with a component binds an animation trigger to an element.\n *\n * ```HTML\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * All transitions are defined within an animation trigger,\n * along with named states that the transitions change to and from.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *  // define states\n *  state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *  state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *  ...]\n * ```\n *\n * Note that when you call the `sequence()` function within a `{\\@link animations/group group()}`\n * or a `transition()` call, execution does not continue to the next instruction\n * until each of the inner animation steps have completed.\n *\n * ### Syntax examples\n *\n * The following examples define transitions between the two defined states (and default states),\n * using various options:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // Transition occurs when the state value\n * // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n * transition(\"on => off\", animate(500))\n * // Run the same animation for both directions\n * transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500))\n * // Define multiple state-change pairs separated by commas\n * transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Special values for state-change expressions\n *\n * - Catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into the page and the\n * destination state is unknown:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *  style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *  animate(500)\n *  ])\n * ```\n *\n * - Capture a state change between any states:\n *\n *  `transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\"))`\n *\n * - Entry and exit transitions:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *   ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n *   ])\n * ```\n *\n * - Use `:increment` and `:decrement` to initiate transitions:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\":increment\", group([\n *  query(':enter', [\n *     style({ left: '100%' }),\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *   ]),\n *  query(':leave', [\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *  ])\n * ]))\n *\n * transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *  query(':enter', [\n *     style({ left: '100%' }),\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *   ]),\n *  query(':leave', [\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *  ])\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * ### State-change functions\n *\n * Here is an example of a `fromState` specified as a state-change function that invokes an\n * animation when true:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition((fromState, toState) =>\n *  {\n *   return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *  },\n *  animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Animating to the final state\n *\n * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value\n * with no style data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,\n * for the element to reach the final state. Angular automatically adds or removes\n * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n *\n * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,\n * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n *  ])\n * ```\n * ### Boolean value matching\n * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression\n * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * \\@publicApi\n *\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr A Boolean expression or function that compares the previous and current\n * animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur. Note that  \"true\" and \"false\"\n * match 1 and 0, respectively. An expression is evaluated each time a state change occurs in the\n * animation trigger element.\n * The animation steps run when the expression evaluates to true.\n *\n * - A state-change string takes the form \"state1 => state2\", where each side is a defined animation\n * state, or an asterix (*) to refer to a dynamic start or end state.\n *   - The expression string can contain multiple comma-separated statements;\n * for example \"state1 => state2, state3 => state4\".\n *   - Special values `:enter` and `:leave` initiate a transition on the entry and exit states,\n * equivalent to  \"void => *\"  and \"* => void\".\n *   - Special values `:increment` and `:decrement` initiate a transition when a numeric value has\n * increased or decreased in value.\n * - A function is executed each time a state change occurs in the animation trigger element.\n * The animation steps run when the function returns true.\n *\n * @param {?} steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()` or\n * `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param {?=} options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the animation,\n * and additional developer-defined parameters.
